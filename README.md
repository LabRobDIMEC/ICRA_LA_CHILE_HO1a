# Planar Subactuated Locomotion Mechanism for a Quadruped Robot Leg
Instructors: [Francisco CÃ¡ceres](https://github.com/Panxouu) and [Fernando Navarrete](https://github.com/FernandoN23)

This introductory workshop addresses the design of mechanisms for a quadruped robotic leg with motion restricted to one plane. The fundamentals of underactuated locomotion will be explored as an efficient alternative to the use of motors at each joint, allowing the generation of coordinated movements with fewer actuators. Through CAD tools, simulations and a hands-on experience with a physical prototype, participants will be guided through the first steps of mechanical design applied to walking robots.
